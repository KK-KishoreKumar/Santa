# Santa, the christmas greeting ascii art!

This is a simple enough program that I wrote initially on Christmas 2020, when I would normally be going to see relatives etc. However, due to Covid, I was housebound and bored, so I thought I'd turn back on my favorite little C library, Ncurses. The result is this toy program, which shows an animated Santa and his reindeer, flying through the snow. It takes no commandline arguments, and has limited controls as follows:

- add or subtract reindeer: a/s
- increase or decrease animation speed: +/-
- quit: q

Feel free to fork and alter, but please give me credit where it is due!
